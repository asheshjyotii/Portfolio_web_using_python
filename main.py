    ### Hi, I'm Ashesh Jyoti Majumdar

I'm a curious and driven B.Tech undergraduate in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. I enjoy building thoughtful tech solutions and continuously learning across domains like computer vision, machine learning, and full-stack development.

I've participated in multiple hackathons and love collaborating on meaningful projects. You‚Äôll often find me exploring new tools, tinkering with code, or diving into open-source.
